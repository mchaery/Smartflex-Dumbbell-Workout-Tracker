# Smartflex-Dumbbell-Workout-Tracker-
Arduino code for a wearable wrist-strap device capable of monitoring the movements of arms during a dumbbell workout.

Users can set their target reps and sets, as well as the desired range of motion. The program tracks each repetition using gyroscope sensor readings. For every completed rep, an LED blinks to notify the user. Real-time progress can be monitored through the display. Once the target is achieved, the program signals completion and resets the goals for the next workout session.
